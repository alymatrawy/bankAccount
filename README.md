# bankAccount
Used Java OOP to create a bank interface. Data is loaded from a CSV file. Users can then view balance, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money.

IMPORTANT
-Code succesfully reads data from csv file, sorts the accounts into checking and savings and creates unique account details depending on the account type and prints all the info to the console
- project not fully complete, stil working on user interface and API to access interest rates.
